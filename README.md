# PokÃ©mon Red and Blue SGB Palettes and Spaceworld Backsprites

This fork of pokered is outdated, and can only be compiled with RGBDS v0.3.3. I'm only uploading this to document the changes that I made to pokered in case someone wants to update them for the current version or port them to their own older, v0.3.3 based disassembly.

## Changelog

1.1
-Fixed several graphical bugs relating to the Pokemon Yellow code
-Lots of quality of life additions (some optional):
-Move Deleter
-Tradeback NPC
-Prof. Oak Battle
-Sleep max turns-->6 (from 7) (optional)
-Low HP alert tone relief
-Alternate frontsprites for 3 Pokemon (optional)

1.0
-Original release

## Features

1. Backwards compatible color palettes in GBC mode ported from the North American Yellow Version (so the game is playable on a DMG and SGB). Some palettes were altered from Yellow--specifically the MEWMON, GREYMON, LOGO1, and LOGO2 palettes.


2. Higher-res backsprites that fit with the art style of the frontsprites from this era (as they are made by Game Freak). Several backsprites were slightly cropped if a.) they had empty space at the bottom of their box, or if b.) their limbs seemed out of proportion.
	
List of backsprites that were cropped:
	-Mew
	-Gyarados
	-Oddish
	-Vileplume
	-Magneton
	-Slowpoke
	-Parasect
	-Dugtrio
	-Articuno
	-Fearow
	-Nidoking, Electabuzz, Bulbasaur, Caterpie, Cubone, Eevee, Jigglypuff, Kabuto, Weedle, Kakuna, Tentacool, Squirtle, Shellder, Psyduck, Mankey, Krabby, Poliwag, Pikachu, Paras, Omanyte, Nidoran (M), and Nidoran (F) (these ones had empty space at the bottom of their box)
	-Golbat's backsprite had its huge protruding eye toned down
		
3. Some quality of life improvements were made to HM learnsets. Some mons had their HM learnsets changed to more closely match the learnsets from future generations.
	
List of Pokemon that had HMs ADDED to their learnset:
	-Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur
	-Charizard
	-Pikachu, Raichu
	-Nidorina, Nidorino
	-Muk
	-Rapidash
	-Arcanine
	-Dragonite
	-Diglett, Dugtrio
	-Raticate
	-Venonat, Venomoth
	-Butterfree
	-Exeggcute, Exeggutor
	-Psyduck, Golduck
		
		
4. The following quality of life improvements were also made: 

-Professor Oak fight added to post-game on Route 1 (you can fight him as many times as you like)
-A Move Deleter has been added to the Cinnabar Lab lobby
-A Tradeback NPC added to the Celadon Dept. Store 1F for Pokemon that evolve by trading
-Fixed a bug where the bike music would keep playing after falling down a hole, even though you	get kicked off the bike
-Low HP alert stops after 3 repetitions
-Sleep can only last 6 turns max (optional)
-Frontsprites for 3 Pokemon (Fearow, Parasect, and Omastar) were replaced with the versions from Japanese Red and Green (optional)
